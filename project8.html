            My first UE4 project with C++. This was a local multiplayer TPS game that I made as a personal project. I have had a lot of fun implementing the mechanics and getting to know the ins and outs of the engine.
            The biggest challenges for me were the in-engine tasks, seeing as I am a programmer, mainly the animations. However, I managed to tackle the huge learning curve and come out with a quality and
            fun tech demo that can be scaled into a full game.
