            This was my first proper low-level engine architecture experience with making a tool. The challenge of this project was making the tool usable and compatible with all types of projects
            and engines. I had to make sure that the tool was easy to use and could be integrated into any project with minimal effort. I also had to make sure that the tool was efficient and could handle large amounts of data without crashing or slowing down.
            It was a satisfying experience that opened my eyes to the wonders of engine programming.
