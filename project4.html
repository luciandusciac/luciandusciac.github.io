            This is the project I worked on for my final year at university. My main focus was the FPS mechanics, including the weapons system, various player actions, such as leaning, shooting and
            throwing grenades, as well as the inventory system and UI. Another aim was to gain more experience and confidence with UE5 and C++, seeing as it is the industry standard. 
            I also focused on making this project as modular and scalable as possible, so that I can potentially make it into a small-scale game and release it on Steam.
            I go into a lot more detail about this project in my blog post <a href="blog2.html">here</a>.
