            This was not my first low-level engine programming experience, however it was my first time using DirectX. I had to learn a lot about the API and how to use it effectively. The engine is capable of rendering 3D models, textures, and basic lighting effects.
            I made use of those capabilities to create a simple render pipeline and basic GUI that would allow the use to examine various objects. The engine is capable of rendering 3D models, textures, and basic lighting effects.
