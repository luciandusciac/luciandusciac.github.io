            Night in Sanguimesia is a 2D Souls-Lite action game set in a dark fantasy world. The game features fast-paced combat, intricate level design and challenging enemies.
            This was my first studio experience. I was the AI programming lead for this project, working in a team of 4, with a total of 14 people.
            I was responsible for the AI systems, including pathfinding, behavior trees and state machines. I also worked on the combat system, implementing various attacks and combos.
            The project was a great learning experience, and I am proud of the result. You can find the game <a href="https://duskforge-studio.itch.io/night-in-sanguimesia" target="_blank">here</a>.
