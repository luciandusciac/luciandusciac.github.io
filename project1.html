            This was my biggest and most important project to date. My initial role was that of generalist programmer, however, this being an indie studio, I had to wear many hats.
            I was involved in everything from gameplay programming, to feature design, to DevOps and release engineering. It was a challenging, but extremely satisfying experience that has 
            taught me a lot about the game development process. I have witnessed and taken part in this project starting from a small prototype, to a fully fledged game that was released on Steam.
            I am now responsible for the overall technical direction of the game. I have also been involved in the marketing and PR side of things,
            which I hope can bring more exposure to our game and team. I have posted the detailed development experience on my blog, which you can find <a href="BlogPages/blog1.html">here</a>. 
            You can also find the game on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3315890/Front_Lines/" target="_blank">here</a>.
