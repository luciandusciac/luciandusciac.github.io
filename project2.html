            Echoes of the Abbey is a first person horror set in a mental asylum that is haunted by demons. The aim of the game is to identify and banish the demon based on its behaviour while tending to
            the patients that inhabit it. This was a massive project in a team of 55 people. I was responsible for the gameplay programming, being part of two feature teams, AI and Interactables.
            The project had a rocky start, with a lot of changes in direction and scope. However, I was able to adapt and learn a lot from the experience. 
            We managed to release on itch, and I am proud of the result, this having been my first big project with such a massive team. You can find the game <a href="https://duskforge-studio.itch.io/echoes-of-the-abbey" target="_blank">here</a>.
