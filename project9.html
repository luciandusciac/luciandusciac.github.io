            One can probably tell by the quality of this project that this was more of an experiment than a full-fledged game. I wanted to see how far I could push the PS4 hardware and what I could achieve with it.
            I was also experimenting with the PS4 SDK and how to use it effectively. The biggest challenge for me was getting the game to run smoothly on the PS4 hardware, as I had to optimize everything from the graphics to the physics.
            As you can see, the project has some pitfalls, but it has nevertheless been a valuable experience and a precious insight into the world of console game development. I have learned a lot and 
            plan to hone and develop my skills in this direction and area of expertise.
